                Jinnah's father Jinnahbhai Poonja (born 1850) was the youngest of three sons. He married a girl Mithibai with the consent of his parents and moved to the growing port of Karachi. There, the young couple rented an apartment on the second floor of a three-storey house, Wazir Mansion. The Wazir Mansion has since been rebuilt and made into a national monument and museum owing to the fact that the founder of the nation, and one of the greatest leaders of all times was born within its walls.

                On December 25, 1876, Mithibai gave birth to a son, the first of seven children. The fragile infant who appeared so weak that it weighed a few pounds less than normal. But Mithibai was unusually fond of her little boy, insisting he would grow up to be an achiever.

                Officially named Mahomedali Jinnahbhai, his father enrolled him in school when he was sixâ€”the Sindh Madrasatul-Islam; Jinnah was indifferent to his studies and loathed arithmetic, preferring to play outdoors with his friends. His father was especially keen towards his studying arithmetic as it was vital in his business. By the early 1880s' Jinnahbhai Poonja's trade business had prospered greatly. He handled all sorts of goods: cotton, wool, hides, oil-seeds, and grain for export and Manchester manufactured piece of goods, metals, refined sugar imports into the busy port. Business was good and profits were soaring high.

                    Jinnah formally entered politics in 1905 from the platform of the Indian National Congress. He went to England in that year along with Gopal Krishna Gokhale (1866-1915), as a member of a Congress delegation to plead the cause of Indian self-government during the British elections. A year later, he served as Secretary to Dadabhai Noaroji (1825-1917), the then Indian National Congress President, which was considered a great honor for a budding politician.

                    Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah had a long and illustrious political career, which spanned over several decades. Jinnah began his political career in the early 20th century as a member of the Indian National Congress and worked towards Hindu-Muslim unity. However, after growing disillusioned with the Congress's policies, he joined the All India Muslim League in 1913 and became its leader in 1934.

                     Jinnah's leadership of the Muslim League was instrumental in the creation of Pakistan, which he saw as the only solution to protect the rights and interests of the Muslim community in the subcontinent. He worked tirelessly to secure the rights of Muslims and to establish a separate Muslim homeland, which ultimately led to the creation of Pakistan in 1947.

                    The Lahore Resolution, also known as the Pakistan Resolution, was a significant political declaration passed on March 23, 1940, at the All India Muslim League meeting held in Lahore, British India.

                     The Lahore Resolution was a crucial turning point in the history of the subcontinent as it provided the ideological basis for the Muslim League's demand for a separate homeland for Muslims. The resolution was a culmination of years of political struggle and demands for Muslim representation in the government and legislative bodies. Today, the Lahore Resolution is celebrated as Pakistan Day in the country, and it remains a symbol of the aspirations and struggles of the Muslim community in the subcontinent.

                Pakistan's independence in 1947 was a historic moment for the subcontinent, marking the end of British colonial rule and the birth of a new nation. The independence movement, led by the All India Muslim League and its leader, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, called for the creation of a separate Muslim homeland in the subcontinent. The British government, in response to mounting pressure from Indian nationalist movements, agreed to the creation of two separate states, India and Pakistan. On August 14, 1947, Pakistan came into existence, and Jinnah became its first Governor-General.

                    The death of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was a significant loss for the nation. Jinnah passed away on September 11, 1948, in Karachi, after battling with lung cancer. His death came just over a year after Pakistan's independence and was a huge blow to the newly formed country. Jinnah's leadership and vision were instrumental in the creation of Pakistan, and he remained an important figure in the country's early years.
